    "text": "I am a first-year PhD student in Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University, where I am a Vivien Thomas Scholar. My academic background includes a BSc in Biochemistry from the University of Arizona and research experience in computational biochemistry at MIT.\nMy professional background includes serving as a laboratory-based medical technologist with Tséhootsooí Medical Center and leading the Navajo Nation’s Climate Change Program under the Navajo Nation Department of Fish and Wildlife. In my role with the Navajo Nation Climate Change Program, I oversaw $1.2MM in federal and tribal grant dollars focused on effecting climate resiliency measures for the Navajo reservation and her tribal members.\nI have also worked as a research technician at the University of Arizona and MIT. My post-baccalaureate research has included the study of directed evolution to create improved binding variants of the Cop operon repressor protein in Streptococcus pneumoniae and other novel copper-based therapeutics, in addition to the investigation of the properties and significance of the protein-level binding interactions between the Mena-EVH1 protein recognition domain and short peptides, including study of putative bidentate binding regimes for EVH1-interacting peptides.\nIn my spare time, I have served as a mentor for Native American elementary school children, a reading seed mentor for 1st grade students with the Amphitheater public school system, a medical scribe with the Tohono O’Odham Nation Health Care’s emergency department in Sells, AZ, a departmental ambassador for the UAZ Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, and as a tutor for the UAZ Astronomy Department MESCIT program.\nI am passionate about using data to make the world a better place. I believe that data science has the power to address some of the most pressing challenges facing our society, and I am committed to using my skills and experience to make a positive impact. I am particularly interested in research topics in data science related to spatial genomics, ML autoencoders, as well as in environmental health and toxicology."
