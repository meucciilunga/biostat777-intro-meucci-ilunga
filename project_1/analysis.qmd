![Student loan debt can be crushing. How do you avoid it? (source: created specifically for this project via Google Imagen3 LLM/GenAI)](resources/student_loan_debt_2.png)

::: {.callout-note collapse=true}
## AI-usage Notice
Per the 140.777 course syllabus, AI-usage for this course is permitted when it is properly cited and disclosed. This analysis features two AI-generated images! Both were generated via prompting of Google's Gemini LLM. The prompt used was:

"In a vaporwave and flat geometric painting style cartoon: can you generate me an image of a greek statue being crushed by debt; I want the image to represent the student loan crisis, with students being crushed by the weight of their loans now more than ever?

I want the statue to essentially represent a student, with cap and tassle on their head, and to be carrying a giant boulder on their back representing their student loan debt as a weight holding them back. statue should be made of marble. The boulder should simply read: "STUDENT LOAN DEBT"

## Project 1 - Section 2.3.1: A Sample Data Analaysis
**November 2nd, 2024**

The question we're ultimately trying to answer is simple: **how do you pick the college that's right for you while best positioning yourself to avoid student loan debt?** To answer this, we'll embark on a three-factor analysis to investigate trends related to three key sub-questions useful for figuring out what school environment makes the most sense for you, agnostic of what you eventually choose to study. These three sub-questions are:

1. **Which states have the greatest demographic diversity?**
2. **How do long-term career earnings vary with total cost of school attendance (i.e., input-cost v. long-term reward)?**
3. **How has the (inflation-adjusted) cost of attendance for colleges and universities changed over the years?**

::: {.callout-important collapse=true}
## Intended Audience
The inclusion of this is a grading requirement.
:::

**The intended audience for this analysis is recent high school graduates and military veterans interested in going to university for the first time to complete their undergraduate education.**

The data for this analysis was sourced from the TidyTuesday project, originally for their 2020-03-10 podcast episode; the original repository for TidyTuesday 2020-03-10 is available at their github repo: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-03-10. Per TidyTuesday, the underlying data compiled by TidyTyesday for this project was sourced from several places: [1] Historical Averages: [National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=76), [2] Tuition and Fees data: [The Chronicle for Higher Education](https://www.chronicle.com/interactives/tuition-and-fees), [3] Diversity Data: [The Chronicle for Higher Education](https://www.chronicle.com/article/student-diversity-at-4-725-institutions/), and [4] Average cost-of-attendance by income bracket: tuitiontracker.org.

The data dictionary used for the dataset underlying this analysis is also available from the [TidyTuesday github repo for 2020-03-10](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-03-10/readme.md), and reconstituted here for convenience:

Let's plot career earning potentials against cost-of-attendance to see if more expensive schools result in higher long-term payouts.

### **Summary: What does this all mean?**

:::

It's a near universally accepted fact that while college in the United States is uniquely expensive [@atlantic_2018], it can still be worthwile under the right financial circumstances [@nelson2015college]. From our analysis, we see a few things resulting from our three factor test: (1) Colleges have become fairly diverse, but some regions of the US have built their broader academic institutions to be better suited for diversity than others; so if diveristy is a priority to you in your college experience, you may want to prioritize a state or region that has stronger diversity metrics born out in the data. (2) Second: your career earnings don't necessarily trend *significantly* upwards with the amount you're paying for school! The relatively flat trendlines seeen for all fifty states when we plot career earning potential against cost-of-attendance show that while their may occasionally be some small long-term financial advantage to going to a more expensive private school over a public option, the difference may not be as large as you might first expect. This small difference in cost-benefit is signicant when factoring in the debt required to attend, and the interest payments that will be governing that debt. (3) Lastly: college is only getting more expensive every year! While you may not want to rush into the decision to go to college, it is wise to consider going as soon as you know it's what you'd like to do; many schools also offer tuition-locks that freeze tuition for the entire length of your degree, which our Factor 3 analysis shows is probably a wise tool to take advantage of. Many students struggle with the cost of their education [@jacobin_2023], which is why it is important to treat the decision to go to school, at least in part, as a financial and career decision. This should include consideration of paths like community college, which some studies have shown can significantly reduce the debt-burden one will take on to complete their education [@romano_2011].
