    "text": "Project 1 - Section 2.3.1: A Sample Data Analaysis\nNovember 2nd, 2024\nThe question we’re ultimately trying to answer is simple: how do you pick the college that’s right for you while best positioning yourself to avoid student loan debt? To answer this, we’ll embark on a three-factor analysis to investigate trends related to three key sub-questions useful for figuring out what school environment makes the most sense for you, agnostic of what you eventually choose to study. These three sub-questions are:\n\nWhich states have the greatest demographic diversity?\nHow do long-term career earnings vary with total cost of school attendance (i.e., input-cost v. long-term reward)?\nHow has the (inflation-adjusted) cost of attendance for colleges and universities changed over the years?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntended Audience\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inclusion of this is a grading requirement.\n\n\n\nThe intended audience for this analysis is recent high school graduates and military veterans interested in going to university for the first time to complete their undergraduate education.\nThe data for this analysis was sourced from the TidyTuesday project, originally for their 2020-03-10 podcast episode; the original repository for TidyTuesday 2020-03-10 is available at their github repo: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-03-10. Per TidyTuesday, the underlying data compiled by TidyTyesday for this project was sourced from several places: [1] Historical Averages: National Center for Education Statistics, [2] Tuition and Fees data: The Chronicle for Higher Education, [3] Diversity Data: The Chronicle for Higher Education, and [4] Average cost-of-attendance by income bracket: tuitiontracker.org.\nThe data dictionary used for the dataset underlying this analysis is also available from the TidyTuesday github repo for 2020-03-10, and reconstituted here for convenience:\n\nData Dictionary\n\ntuition_cost.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable\nclass\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nname\ncharacter\nSchool name\n\n\nstate\ncharacter\nState name\n\n\nstate_code\ncharacter\nState Abbreviation\n\n\ntype\ncharacter\nType: Public, private, for-profit\n\n\ndegree_length\ncharacter\n4 year or 2 year degree\n\n\nroom_and_board\ndouble\nRoom and board in USD\n\n\nin_state_tuition\ndouble\nTuition for in-state residents in USD\n\n\nin_state_total\ndouble\nTotal cost for in-state residents in USD (sum of room & board + in state tuition)\n\n\nout_of_state_tuition\ndouble\nTuition for out-of-state residents in USD\n\n\nout_of_state_total\ndouble\nTotal cost for in-state residents in USD (sum of room & board + out of state tuition)\n\n\n\n\ntuition_income.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable\nclass\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nname\ncharacter\nSchool name\n\n\nstate\ncharacter\nState Name\n\n\ntotal_price\ndouble\nTotal price in USD\n\n\nyear\ndouble\nyear\n\n\ncampus\ncharacter\nOn or off-campus\n\n\nnet_cost\ndouble\nNet-cost - average actually paid after scholarship/award\n\n\nincome_lvl\ncharacter\nIncome bracket\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsalary_potential.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable\nclass\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nrank\ndouble\nPotential salary rank within state\n\n\nname\ncharacter\nName of school\n\n\nstate_name\ncharacter\nstate name\n\n\nearly_career_pay\ndouble\nEstimated early career pay in USD\n\n\nmid_career_pay\ndouble\nEstimated mid career pay in USD\n\n\nmake_world_better_percent\ndouble\nPercent of alumni who think they are making the world a better place\n\n\nstem_percent\ndouble\nPercent of student body in STEM\n\n\n\n\n\nhistorical_tuition.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable\nclass\ndescription\n\n\n\n\ntype\ncharacter\nType of school (All, Public, Private)\n\n\nyear\ncharacter\nAcademic year\n\n\ntuition_type\ncharacter\nTuition Type All Constant (dollar inflation adjusted), 4 year degree constant, 2 year constant, Current to year, 4 year current, 2 year current\n\n\ntuition_cost\ndouble\nTuition cost in USD\n\n\n\n\n\ndiversity_school.csv\n\n\n\nvariable\nclass\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nname\ncharacter\nSchool name\n\n\ntotal_enrollment\ndouble\nTotal enrollment of students\n\n\nstate\ncharacter\nState name\n\n\ncategory\ncharacter\nGroup/Racial/Gender category\n\n\nenrollment\ndouble\nenrollment by category"

And it should be whenever possible. (source: Gemini LLM/Imagen3, created specifically for this project; see AI-usage notice above)\n\n\nIt’s a near universally accepted fact that while college in the United States is uniquely expensive (Ripley 2018), it can still be worthwile under the right financial circumstances (Nelson 2015). From our analysis, we see a few things resulting from our three factor test: (1) Colleges have become fairly diverse, but some regions of the US have built their broader academic institutions to be better suited for diversity than others; so if diveristy is a priority to you in your college experience, you may want to prioritize a state or region that has stronger diversity metrics born out in the data. (2) Second: your career earnings don’t necessarily trend significantly upwards with the amount you’re paying for school! The relatively flat trendlines seeen for all fifty states when we plot career earning potential against cost-of-attendance show that while their may occasionally be some small long-term financial advantage to going to a more expensive private school over a public option, the difference may not be as large as you might first expect. This small difference in cost-benefit is signicant when factoring in the debt required to attend, and the interest payments that will be governing that debt. (3) Lastly: college is only getting more expensive every year! While you may not want to rush into the decision to go to college, it is wise to consider going as soon as you know it’s what you’d like to do; many schools also offer tuition-locks that freeze tuition for the entire length of your degree, which our Factor 3 analysis shows is probably a wise tool to take advantage of. Many students struggle with the cost of their education (Henwood 2023), which is why it is important to treat the decision to go to school, at least in part, as a financial and career decision. This should include consideration of paths like community college, which some studies have shown can significantly reduce the debt-burden one will take on to complete their education (Romano and Djajalaksana 2011).\n\n\nList of Required Functions and *.qmd Attributes Used for Analysis (i.e., dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2 library requirements)\n\ndplyr\n\ndplyr::mutate_if()\ndplyr::select()\ndplyr::group_by()\ndplyr::summarise()\ndplyr::distinct()\ndplyr::left_join()\ndplyr::filter()\ndplyr::rename()\n\ntidyr\n\ntidyr::complete()\ntidyr::pivot_wider()\ntidyr::pivot_longer()\n\nggplot2\n\nggplot2::geom_line()\nggplot2::geom_point()\nggplot2::geom_smooth()\nggplot2::geom_bar()\n\ncallout blocks\n\nAI-usage notice at top of page.\nIntended audience notice.\nMissing values for some schools in Factor 2 section.\nOut-dated data warning in Factor 3 section.\n\nmargin content\n\nused in this section (see little image on right)\n\ncitations\n\n4 in-text citations (linked to references.bib) used in summary section."

In my role with the Navajo Nation Climate Change Program, I oversaw $1.2MM in federal and tribal grant dollars focused on effecting climate resiliency measures for the Navajo reservation and her tribal members.\nI have also worked as a research technician at the University of Arizona and MIT. My post-baccalaureate research has included the study of directed evolution to create improved binding variants of the Cop operon repressor protein in Streptococcus pneumoniae and other novel copper-based therapeutics, in addition to the investigation of the properties and significance of the protein-level binding interactions between the Mena-EVH1 protein recognition domain and short peptides, including study of putative bidentate binding regimes for EVH1-interacting peptides.\nIn my spare time, I have served as a mentor for Native American elementary school children, a reading seed mentor for 1st grade students with the Amphitheater public school system, a medical scribe with the Tohono O’Odham Nation Health Care’s emergency department in Sells, AZ, a departmental ambassador for the UAZ Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, and as a tutor for the UAZ Astronomy Department MESCIT program.\nI am passionate about using data to make the world a better place. I believe that data science has the power to address some of the most pressing challenges facing our society, and I am committed to using my skills and experience to make a positive impact. I am particularly interested in research topics in data science related to spatial genomics, ML autoencoders, as well as in environmental health and toxicology."
